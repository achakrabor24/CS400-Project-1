Ever since he could talk, Ricky wanted a puppy. He spent most of his time researching dogs and could identify practically any breed by just a glance. After a year of dedicated analysis,
Ricky was sure he wanted to adopt a golden retriever. He begged his parents for one every single day. 
Yet they always said no. He cried and cried but his parents would not give in. Until one day, on his birthday, he opened his presents and a puppy sprung out.
But much to Ricky's chagrin, the puppy was brown and spotted. Ricky stormed off to his room, "This is not a golden retriever!" he complained. However, deep in his 
own thoughts and emotions, Ricky eventually emerged from his room two hours later. He realized he would love his new puppy no matter what and care for it like it
deserved. Ricky and his new puppy lived happily ever after and solved crimes out of a van with some local teenagers.
